# Amazon-Link-Clicker
This project automates browsing and interaction on the Amazon India website using Selenium WebDriver. It captures all hyperlinks on the homepage and attempts to click them, printing each page's title and URL. A great starting point to learn link extraction and browser automation using Java and Selenium.
